To experiment with using Hackflight for flight control in Haskell, you'll first
need to install [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [NASA
Copilot](https://copilot-language.github.io) (the &ldquo;secret sauce&rdquo;
that allows you to compile Haskell code to a form suitable for running on a
flight controller.)  I was able to do this via:

```
cabal install copilot
cabal install copilot-c99
```
