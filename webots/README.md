# Hackflight / Webots instructions

First install [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) on your computer.  Then from the hackflight main
directory, do the following:

```
cd webots/controllers/cplusplus
make
cd ../..
make cplusplus
```

If you have a game controller or R/C transmitter with adapter dongle, you can
use that to fly;  otherwise, the simulator will advise you that no such device
was found and instruct you on how to fly with the keyboard.
```
